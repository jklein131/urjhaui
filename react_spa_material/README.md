## next steps from VA meeting 

### notes from VA meeting: 
+// standard format (this may just be RAC on the upper left side. We may have to have multiple formats which can be selected)
+// BIGGER RAC on title 
+// add signature sheet on pdf 
+// Description for each JHA to help describe what the task they are doing it 
+// We likely need also an equipment and permit database, because that is a requirement by my knowledge of what the VA needs for their requirements. 
+// Compile all the documents that I found with the VA requirements for AHA from the US army corp of engineers 
+// We have a meeting when we get back from hawaii with Procore about an integration, see if you can get a demo about procore before moving forward with that meeting. 

## big asks 
+// multi-tenancy with other clients, likely to colaborate on PDF's by sending a link
+// automated workflow with email notifications (this would be nice to add if firebase supports it.)
+// job specific edits in addition to hazard update approval process. 
+// a way to view and comment on a JHA by email.
